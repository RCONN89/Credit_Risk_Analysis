# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
For this project we will be using machine learning models to predict credit risk. We will be using only supervised machine learning models because calculating credit risk is too important and effects people's lives too heavely, therefore it is necessary that we make our machine learning models are as accurate as possible before they are deployed. Existing credit risk data certainly has all sorts of bias so we will be using ensamble machine learning models to try to correct this. 
## Results
- EasyEnsembleClassifier = 93.16%
- BalancedRandomForestClassifier = 78.85%
- RandomOverSampler = 64.66%
- SMOTE = 66.23%
- SMOTEEN = 64%
- ClusterCentroids = 54.42%
##Summary

It is clear that EasyEnsembleClassifier is the best option it has the highest accuracy rate and the least likely to have bias.
